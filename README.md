## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

A lot. From using, styling and positioning divs, flex boxes and grids to conditionally modifying styles and so so much more. But first and foremost understanding all the concepts.

I am sure the end result probably contains some bad practice, and things that could have been done in a better way, but — at least to me — it seems very much functional.




### Useful resources
